    "- **Notebook 05**: We introduced Agents and Tools in order to be able to solve a more complex task: ask questions to Tabular datasets\n",

It is a framework of a logic programming language that is parametrized with respect to constraint language and a domain of computation, and yields soundness and completeness results for an operational semantics relying on a constraint solver for the employed constraint language. It is also described as a more procedural representation compared to the declarative FOL representation used by ACLP, and can be embedded with various constraint languages. \n",

It is obtained as the observation process of an ordinary Markov chain corrupted by noise and is defined through its stochastic relation to another process. There has been a great deal of work on the entropy rate of a hidden Markov chain, and relaxed sufficient conditions for analyticity of the entropy rate have been given. \n",
